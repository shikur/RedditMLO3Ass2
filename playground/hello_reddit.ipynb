Same as in social activism, financial activism relies on organizing ourselves, in chasing reform and change that has positive impact on our local and global communities alike.\\n\\nWealth inequality needs to be tackled at all levels of society, not just by policy. The system is wide and far-reaching and we must use everything available to us so that we may carve the life we want for ourselves and our children.\\n\\nGME is a good company, with a solid investment thesis and more importantly, the potential to transition into something that our generation of gamers sorely needs.

This is a grassroots push for a more equitable system. This is a way to expose corruption and greed. This is a way to force the system to change.\\n\\nWhat happened: A number of wealthy people attempted to make themselves richer by manipulating loopholes in the market. They borrowed shares of Gamestop, sold them, and trashed the company publicly in an attempt to force Gamestop out of business. Aside from being wildly unethical, these wealthy people leveraged financial tools (short selling on margin/naked short selling) that only exist to make rich people richer. These tools exist for no other purpose. They do not add any value to our society. What they did is analogous to betting that your grandma will die, and then killing her yourself.\\n\\nWhat does this mean: This means that the rich people who were engaged in unethical practices (see above) were caught with their pants down. It means that they stand to lose billions of dollars. It means that many of us “amateur” traders stand to permanently change our circumstances. It means we can afford rent and food without going into debt, buy our first house, pay off our student loans, pay for our kids’ schools, invest in our retirements, start small businesses, pursue a passion, PROGRESS in life. Perhaps most importantly, it provides us with a VOICE. \\n\\nWhat can you do: Identify and contact your local, state and federal representatives. Tell them that if anything fishy happens with the Gamestop situation, you will never ever vote for them again. Make your voice heard on social media. Talk to your friends and family about it. Don’t listen to anyone who tells you that “these reddit people are crazy, this stock is worthless, innocent people are going to get hurt, this undermines the mechanics of the free market, etc.” That is all bullshit. The fact of the matter is, the wealthy people mentioned above are panicking, and are willing to say anything to undermine the cause and hold onto their ill-begotten wealth. \\n\\nIf you like the $GME stock as much as I do, BUY IT AND HOLD IT.

I hope some of you get to read it.\\n\\nI\\'ve been watching this amazing movement unfold from the sidelines in Australia. Reading the stories of people who lost so much in 08 was harrowing. I don\\'t think people outside the US realise just how hard it hit everyday people there. I didn\\'t.\\n\\nFor the last few years, and more so recently, watching the USA fight itself, neighbour against neighbour, and the idea that the individual comes first no mater what, it looked like you guys had lost that part of America that did make you great. It\\'s a thing that\\'s hard to articulate, but what you are doing now, the coming together, the standing up and fighting, the belief in right and wrong, but more so the sense that you are looking out for each other and have each others backs - that\\'s it - that\\'s what makes America great.\\n\\nYou all know this, but this is now way beyond just a story about share prices. Really, I don\\'t think anyone will fully know whats\\' it about for a while, but you all have changed the world. (Too much? No fuck it! You guys have changed the world.)\\n\\nYou may be interested to know that here in Australia, this has been reported in the financial press in the last weeks, but is a headline mainstream story in the last few days. The average Aussie eating their Vegemite on toast knows who you guys are! The coverage is fairly accurate - (it\\'s a hard thing to report on as the average person doesn\\'t understand short selling) In the non-Murdoch press, you are being represented as a group of retail investors, who have banded together, to stop a huge investment house from potentially destroying a company you love, buy their often dodgy manipulation of the market.\\n\\nA couple of other quick things: The media isn\\'t brave enough to say \"deepfuckingvalue\" and some of the other user names. You guys predicted how funny that all would be. You were right. Also, there is a mining company here in Australia with the stock code GME. It\\'s share price was up by 50% on Thursday, from Aussies accidentally thinking it was Gamestop.\\n\\nGood luck retards. The 99% is with you.',\n",

They rather interview  idiot boomer suits who've never done anything other than speak off the cuff about shit they don't even understand like it's a sunday talk show. DFV had the brains to see an opportunity almost no else saw and also had the balls to put his own money behind it. That's an important distinction: Fucking Idiot Plotkin once he burns through the 13 billion in his fund, he will still have a few hundred million in savings and really doesn't give a fuck about worrying too much going forward. He can just follow that boomer narrative that this was all unfair and not a reflection on how brilliant he is as an investor and has daddy Cohen to vouch for him. And where do you think the 13 billion he has in his fund comes from? A lot of it probably comes from pension funds. So yeah this little idiot bitch is playing with our retirement money like it's fucking monopoly, he's bullying businesses into bankruptcy and when things don't start going his way he's resorting to market manipulation tactics and having cnbc put out fake stories that he's out of his investment when we all can see the short interest has barely moved from 140%. These fuckers are so entitled to getting their way that they can't possibly imagine that regular people having fun can also collaborate online to build compelling investment thesis and put their own money behind it. Also these fucking idiots would know that there is no fucking consensus in this board, just take a look at DFV's history and most people were calling him a boomer idiot a few months ago (obviously those guys are now permabanned for insulting our daddy DFV).

       " [' \\n\\n>Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:  \\nFunds  can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to “tap” down prices.  And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem  like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short  strategy...buying but as long as we hold it’s only a temporary decrease  in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of  10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I’ve lowered  the stock price  by $100 effectively. It’s a classic short move.  \\nIf  you don’t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up  aren’t calling in favors like this right now you’re living in fantasy  land.  \\nSo for a small amount of  shares you can take the price of the stock. It’s only going to save  shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the  new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but  shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they  used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells  the tale of a bear raid. There’s no way this is going to work- I feel  like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate  GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are  likely fucked  \\nPlease share and  upvote this for god sakes so people don’t think everyone else selling  out and giving up!!!!

The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.\\n\\nHedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.\\n\\nIn reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.\\n\\nSo, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders\\n\\nInfo of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg\\\\_WU-0AQ&ab\\\\_channel=StocksBigPlays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&ab_channel=StocksBigPlays)\\n\\n**WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM DOING THIS FOREVER?**\\n\\nWell, unlike us retarded diamond handed monkeys, everyone with a short position has to pay daily interest on their positions to their broker. The longer they wait the more they have to pay to stay in the game. This is a war of attrition, but one side (us) does not have a financial penalty for staying on the battlefield, the other side (those with short positions) do.\",\n",

If someone can please correct me on any assumptions I made that will be fucking appreciated because I learn best from experience like any other degenerate ape.\\n\\nSo now to the main point. Why the fuck do I think the price of GME has stalled and dropped?\\n\\nAnswer: They are trying to short ladder but don't have enough shares available to tank the price completely so they are kinda short laddering with whatever shorts are available just to hold back the dam.\\n\\nFirst: Lets understand what a short ladder is. A short ladder occurs when hedge funds coordinate with each other to purposely short one stock. They trade shorts with each other rapidly to drive the price down. Classic example of this was last week when the price dived from 450+ to under 200 (coupled with Robinhood backstabbing all of us)\\n\\nQuestion: Why don't they do this shit infinitely?\\n\\nAnswer: it costs them a fuck ton of money to do so and they are already bleeding capital from the interest rate on their existing shorts.\\n\\nQuestion: How the fuck do I know there is a short ladder attack?\\n\\nAnswer: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades\\n\\nDoes this shit look natural to you? Its Monday. Options aren't expiring. Look at the fucking share volume being done in constant streams of 100. Like wtf is this shit. It looks more like two desperate hedge fundies are playing hot potato with a 100 shares desperate to keep the price low because that's all they got.\\n\\nQuestion: How do I know it isn't some paper handed bitches just bailing on us like little dicks?\\n\\nAnswer: https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml\\n\\nToday's buy order to sell order balance is fucking insane. As of this post at 12:38pm on 2/1/2021 its 136,000 buy orders to 35,000 sell orders. There are 4 times more fucking buyers than sellers right now.\\n\\nQuestion: How the fuck do I know that there aren't any shorts available?\\n\\nAnswer: Fucking try right now. Go to fidelity, robinhood, interactive broker, or any other broker right now and TRY to short (obviously don't fucking actually short you degen ape). They are outright stating there are no stocks to short right now.\\n\\nQuestion: So what do we do with this fucking information?\\n\\nAnswer: If you already bought as much as you can fucking stop looking at the market right now and screaming into the wind. If you are able to afford more fucking buy more during this dip. ALL PEOPLE NEED TO PLACE LIMIT ORDERS ON THEIR SHARES TO PREVENT YOUR FUCKING BROKERS FROM ALLOWING HEDGIES TO USE YOUR SHARES TO SHORT.\\n\\nI am a class A fucking retard. I am holding this shit with diamond hands to the fucking moon.\\n\\nTLDR: They are running out of shorts and can't fucking short enough to lower the price drastically so instead they are desperately shorting with what they have to stop the flood.\\n\\nEdit: I am sorry guys I am getting notifications about people replying to my post however I can't reply back because unfortunately your replies are being auto-deleted by the auto mod.\"],\n",
