continuing to be severely manipulated by news outlets across the country . i am sure you are aware of the current situation revolving around gamestop stock and the reddit forum r/wallstreetbets . in the latest attack by the media on our financial institutions and free access to information, news outlets across the country are claiming that the wallstreetbets group is targeting financial investments in silver . this claim is a complete fabrication and is being used to manipulate unknowing retail investors into buying stock in silver as a means to increase the value of silver so that wall st . hedge funds like citadel llc\u00a0that are invested in silver are able to reap a profit from misinforming the general public . this is a blatant attack on our free markets and access to true press that reports in accordance with reality . \n\nas a consumer and a us citizen, i am deeply concerned with the actions of the press as they continue to misinform the people of this country as a means to financially cater to the ultra-wealthy . i ask that you fight to address and investigate this blatant act of deception by the press .\n\nthank you for your time and effort to preserving the
